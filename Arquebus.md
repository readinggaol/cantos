Arquebus is one of the main antagonists.

Ultimately, Arquebus is aware of some important things:

1. He knows about [[The Long Verse]], and understands that it's more powerful than the [[Infernal Gestalt]] realises. He also seems to understand the dichotomy between demonic magic and The Long Verse: that they are different but the same.
2. He has a relationship with [[Patton Glair]], feeding him other demons for his [[sangrosmith]] [[Cecil Bishop]] in exchange for information regarding the fey.
3. [[The Hells]] are uniquely vulnerable to [[The Long Verse]] because of how regimented it is. The demons living there are incapable of predicting/using/interacting fey magic because they lack the capacity for poetry. Arquebus, however, DOES seem to understand how to use it, and has done some experimentation to that effect.

Arquebus intercepts [[Gawain Raster]] on his way to the afterlife because he can sense the fey curse affecting his soul. He sends him back to kill [[Rowan Kirdech]], thinking that this will neatly nip the burgeoning fey magic at the bud, lowering competition for himself and awareness on the part of the [[Infernal Gestalt]]. In doing this, he writes an illegal contract which is accidentally noticed by [[Iona Argent]], who brings it to the attention of her mentor, [[Adronax Phlogiston]], who then secures a court injunction to temporarily break Arquebus' contract. At first, Arquebus doesn't understand that Iona was only using Adronax's magic, and tortures Adronax for information before murdering him. He then attempts to frame Iona for the murder of her mentor, all while trying to kill her as well and put Gawain 'back in the box' as it were before the lid gets blown off his scheme.

He's pretty furious with Iona.
