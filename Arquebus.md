Arquebus is one of the main antagonists.

Ultimately, Arquebus is aware of some important things:

1. He knows about [[The Long Verse]], understands that it's controlled by [[The Whisper]], and is more powerful than the [[Infernal Gestalt]] realises. He sees the Whisper as a role model, and wants to control the [[Infernal Gestalt]] and its magic in the same way that the Whisper controls fey magic. To that end, he works with the Whispers, hoping that they might both become masters of their respective worlds.
2. He has a relationship with [[Patton Glair]], feeding him other demons for his [[sangrosmith]] [[Cecil Bishop]] in exchange for information regarding the fey. He knows that Glair desires to control the human realm, but believes that this is ultimately pointless in the face of controlling a world of magic instead. Arquebus believes that humans will ultimately be controlled by either the world of demons or of the fey.
3. [[The Hells]] are uniquely vulnerable to [[The Long Verse]] because of how regimented it is. The demons living there are incapable of predicting/using/interacting fey magic because they lack the capacity for poetry. This gives him the opportunity to do things that demons would otherwise always get caught doing, like counterfeiting, murder, forgery, etc.

Arquebus intercepts [[Gawain Raster]] on his way to the afterlife because the Whisper wants Rowan Kirdech dead and is compelled by Rowan's magic to ask Arquebus to do it (see [[liminal fragmentation]]. He sends him back to kill [[Rowan Kirdech]] so that he might be able to ask more favours of the Whisper in the future. To do this, he writes an illegal contract which is accidentally noticed by [[Iona Argent]], who brings it to the attention of her mentor, [[Adronax Phlogiston]], who then secures a court injunction to temporarily break Arquebus' contract. At first, Arquebus doesn't understand that Iona was only using Adronax's magic, and tortures Adronax for information before murdering him. He then attempts to frame Iona for the murder of her mentor, all while trying to kill her as well and put Gawain 'back in the box' as it were before the lid gets blown off his scheme.

He's pretty furious with Iona.
