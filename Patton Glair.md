Fey-touched member of the [[Glair Family]] that left [[Wexcombe]] to set up shop in [[Caer Llanir]], a castle near [[Brithym]] that he believes has a connection to the fey realm. He is likely correct.

He has a turbulent, complicated, and villainous history with [[Cecil Bishop]] (story on Cecil's page) and [[Hexworthy]].

Patton has ambitions of exceeding his family's already high status and installing himself among the proper nobility of Wexcombe. He has unique knowledge of [[The Long Verse]] after betraying Cecil, and is leveraging that against his preexisting knowledge of demonic magic to call in favours on both sides. He works in tandem with [[Arquebus]], trading information regarding fey magic in exchange for demon blood (precious metals) and entire captive demons that he can have Cecil process in the bloodforge beneath Caer Llanir.

He is the main human antagonist.
