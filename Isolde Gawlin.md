Daughter of [[Birk Gawlin]] and resident of [[Brithym]]. Received the book [[Zizania]] from [[Birk Gawlin]], which gives her the ability to use magic. She struggles with the idea of using this magic, which she has often seen do terrible things.

She is in love with [[Gawain Raster]], and went to [[Caer Llanir]] to help him recover. However, she soon begins to fall in love with [[Rowan Kirdech]] as well. 

She accidentally (but perhaps not really) killed [[Russo]] when she interacted with the curse laid on him, unweaving his body. She was extremely upset by this turn of events, both because of what she had done but also because she possible subconsciously asked for it to happen.
