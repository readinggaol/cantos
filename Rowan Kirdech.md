Rowan is the son of [[Danil Kirdech]] and former resident of [[Cygnil]] who now works for [[Patton Glair]] in [[Caer Llanir]]. He is love with [[Isolde Gawlin]].

Rowan appears to be the main mover of the fey curse affecting [[Gawain Raster]], though he doesn't know it. He is the only curse-touched person that doesn't dream of/interact with [[The Whisper]].

It is possible that he is important or relevant to as-yet-unknown events in [[The Long Verse]].
