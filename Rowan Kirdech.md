Rowan is the son of [[Danil Kirdech]] and former resident of [[Cygnil]] who now works for [[Patton Glair]] in [[Caer Llanir]]. He is love with [[Isolde Gawlin]].

Rowan appears to be the main mover of the fey curse affecting [[Gawain Raster]], though he doesn't know it. He is the only curse-touched person that doesn't dream of/interact with [[The Whisper]].

He is hugely relevant to [[The Long Verse]] because ***he is deaf to it***.

Rowan's magical trick is that he is entirely deaf to the Whisper. In fact, he appears only to be able to negate/stop/invert fey magic. For example, the Whisper intended on breaking Rowan's soul with the abuse from his father Danil, which the Whisper successfully controlled. However, Rowan killed his father without becoming as evil as the Whisper might have hoped. When the Whisper then sent [[Russo]] to kill him, Rowan didn't die. When the Whisper cursed his bow and tried to make him kill [[Gawain Raster]], he inadvertently ***broke the curse*** and caused Gawain [[liminal fragmentation]] instead. Truthfully, Rowan ***saved*** Gawain instead of killing him.

The Whisper is intent on killing Rowan as fast as possible. Rowan has a deeply calming/steadying effect on Isolde, and the Whisper realises that she might be one of the first spellcasters that might challenge for primary authorship of the Long Verse. Everything fey that Rowan touches runs contrary to what the Whisper designs, and so without even knowing it Rowan might be the single most important magical entity alive.

It's also worth noting that Isolde is one of the main things that keeps him so positive. It might be more true to say then that their relationship is actually the most important magical thing.
