-a state of being split in two on the level of a soul

-a rare state of being, with very few resolutions. Basically the victim can:
A. try to fuse the parts of their soul back together, ensuring wholeness in the 'afterlife', whatever that entails
B. one half can destroy the other in an act of [[liminal severance]], saving one part at the expense of the other parts. It's unclear how this will affect the part doing the destroying, but it will cease to be 'a part' and will become 'a whole'
