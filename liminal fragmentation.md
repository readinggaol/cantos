-a state of being split in two on the level of a soul

-a rare state of being, with very few resolutions. Basically the victim can:
A. try to fuse the parts of their soul back together, ensuring wholeness in the 'afterlife', whatever that entails
B. one half can destroy the other in an act of [[liminal severance]], saving one part at the expense of the other parts. It's unclear how this will affect the part doing the destroying, but it will cease to be 'a part' and will become 'a whole'

TIMELINE FOR GAWAIN'S FRAGMENTATION:
1. The Whisper is trying to kill Rowan (Danil, Russo, etc.)
2. In frustration (or perhaps long-game strategy), the Whisper tries to make Rowan kill Gawain
3. Rowan shoots Gawain, but inverts the spell, compelling the Whisper to ask Arquebus to return Gawain's soul. So basically, Rowan's spell causes the Whisper to call in a favour with Arquebus
4. When Arquebus decides to fuck with Gawain and return him as a dog, his contract inadvertently conflicts with Rowan's fey spell. Both spells 'succeed', the fey spell returning a piece of his soul to his corpse, and Arquebus' contract returning a piece of his soul into his dog form
5. When Iona undoes Arquebus' contract and tries to send him back to the Hells, Gawain becomes virtually immortal. He's independent and can't be killed/moved to the Hells due to his new fragmentation
