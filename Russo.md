A resident of [[Brithym]] and friend of [[Gawain Raster]]

Is cursed by [[Hexworthy]] after chasing [[Rowan Kirdech]] into the woods. This curse eventually causes him to seek help from [[Isolde Gawlin]]. This, however, does not go to plan. [[Isolde Gawlin]]'s magic kills him by 'unweaving' his body.
