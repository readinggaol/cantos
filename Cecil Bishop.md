Cecil Bishop (generally just called Bishop) is a talented surgeon and [[sangrosmith]] that has been in the employ of the [[Glair Family]] for the entirety of his professional career. He is responsible for the creation of [[Hexworthy]], an act that he perpetually regrets.

In fact though, Cecil Bishop was not originally a surgeon or sangrosmith at all. His late father [[August Bishop]] was indeed a sangrosmith and metallurgist, and was employed by the Glair Family, but Cecil's career actually began as a disgraced biology student. While studying in Wexcombe, Cecil accompanied his father on a prospecting expedition to [[Scaletip Island]] during a school break, where friends of his father believed there was a good untapped source of copper.

During the trip, Cecil encountered a creature named [[Mishi]] that lived on the island and seemed to have unexplained magic powers. Cecil's stories about Mishi were dismissed by his father as fabrications, but Cecil persisted, becoming more and more interested in cryptids in general.

This was deeply embarrassing for his father and the Glair family, who began distancing themselves from him as he steadily lost academic favour. However, Mishi returned to visit Cecil many times, and the two became fast friends, with Mishi showing Cecil how to manipulate fey magic. Cecil used the magic to help pass his courses, learning more and more each day. He eventually became too competent to ignore, and used his fey magic to help write dissertations that propelled him to fame among the surgical and metallurgist communities.

However, he was wracked with guilt about 'cheating' his way to the top of his field, and as he dabbled more with fey magic, he began to fall under the influence of [[The Whisper]]. His experiments became increasingly risky, dangerous, and dark.

The youngest son of the Glair family, [[Patton Glair]], grew closer to the increasingly edgy Cecil Bishop, believing that a partnership between them could put them both on top. Cecil confessed to Patton about his use of fey magic and his fear about succumbing to the Whisper, but Patton shrugged his fears aside, pointing to the amazing work that he had been able to do.

When a mutual friend of theirs tragically died, Patton suggested that Cecil use his magic to try and bring him back. Mishi emphatically warned Cecil against this, telling him that the current overwhelming darkness of [[The Long Verse]] would never permit him to bring someone back from the dead. When Cecil tried anyway, he ended up creating a nightmarish undead creature they would end up calling [[Hexworthy]].

Traumatised by what he had done, Cecil begged Mishi to remove his memories of all fey magic so that he wouldn't ever be at risk of doing something so terrible again. Unfortunately, this would also mean that Cecil would have to forget Mishi as well. After a painful farewell, Mishi ultimately agreed, erasing Cecil's memories and replacing them with memories of things he never did in order to make up the lost time. Unfortunately, this meant that Mishi ***had to rely on memories connected to his father and sangromancy***. The resulting personality that was left behind wasn't much like the friend that Mishi had made on Scaletip Island. Patton also agreed to have his memories erased, but at the last second he rejected the spell, keeping his knowledge of fey magic intact, even though he couldn't use it.

***IMPORTANT FOR STORY***
When [[Gawain Raster]] attempts to kill Bishop in the bloodforge, Mishi can't help but save her old friend, whisking Cecil away at the last second. She knows that they'll need every single good-hearted fey spellcaster if they're going to defeat the Whisper, and she believes that if Cecil's memories can be restored he might be one of them.

Even though Cecil doesn't remember creating Hexworthy, his soul still recoils from what he did, which is why he hates being around the hedge knight so much.
