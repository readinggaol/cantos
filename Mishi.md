Mishi is a mishipeshu, or 'underwater panther' from First Nations mythology. She is from [[Scaletip Island]], but doesn't spend much of her time there anymore.

She most commonly appears as a black housecat with green eyes, copper ears and a copper collar.

She has many magical abilities, including the ability to teleport through water, sense sources of magic, transform into a massive cat-serpent, control snakes/other water animals, and manipulate memories. She is naturally covetous of copper, hoarding it a little like a dragon on Scaletip Island.

She was a longtime friend of [[Cecil Bishop]] before having to erase his memories (read Cecil's page for more).

Mishi fundamentally understands the way [[The Long Verse]] works, and has noticed that several fey-touched people have started to emerge in the same place. Taking advantage of this, Mishi is trying to protect/shelter/guide/otherwise help them so that they might collectively challenge [[The Whisper]] for authorship and turn the tide of fey magic towards a state of being more balanced, as it should be.

She is currently helping [[Gawain Raster]] master his new fey magic. As a fey creature herself, she can help him manage the magic by acting as a kind of 'stabiliser' in the same way Rowan evens out Isolde.
